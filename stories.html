            <h3>From Darkness to Light</h3>
            <video src="videos/light.mp4" controls style="max-width: 100%;"></video>
            <p>I struggled with depression for a long time. There were days when I didn't want to get out of bed, when I felt like there was no hope. But I found strength in connecting with others who were going through similar experiences. We shared our stories, our struggles, and our triumphs. Knowing I wasn't alone made all the difference. Now, I want to share my journey to help others find their own light. <a href="story2.html">Read More...</a></p>

            <img src="images/journey.jpg" alt="A person looking at a map" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p>Moving to a new country was one of the scariest and most rewarding experiences of my life. I left everything I knew behind, my family, my friends, my culture. It was a journey of self-discovery, of learning to adapt and grow. I learned to embrace new perspectives and found a strength I never knew I had. I want to share my experience so that others know that change, while scary, can be beautiful. <a href="story3.html">Read More...</a></p>

            <h3>The Power of Kindness</h3>
            <video src="videos/kindness.mp4" controls style="max-width: 100%;"></video>
            <p>One small act of kindness can change someone's life. I learned this firsthand when a stranger offered me a helping hand during a difficult time. Their simple gesture of compassion reminded me that there is still good in the world, and it inspired me to pay it forward. Now, I strive to be a source of kindness for others, to spread hope and positivity wherever I go. <a href="story4.html">Read More...</a></p>
